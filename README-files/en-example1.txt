&Title of the system can be optionally put on the first line of the file after & symbol
pass start each line with the description of the call and then put it's meaning
	1c then describe responses in a line starting with a single tab character
		1d then responses to that bid with double tab character at the start
			1h etc.
		#Lines starting with '#' are comments, they are ignored by the parser
		#and can be used to make the file more readable for yourself
		#to describe responses for some previous bid use one more tab
		#then the bid we're responding to
		1h so this is a response to 1c
		1s and so is this
		1n Comments #can also be put at the end 
		2c Click a bid to fold/unfold direct responses to it
		2d Right click/long tap on a touch-screen to unfold
			2h all subsequent nodes
		2h suit symbols described using either ♠/♥/♦/♣ or !s/!h/!d/!c
			2s are automatically replaced with actual symbols and
			2n coloured blue/red/orange/green
	1d This is a response to pass
		(1h) for competitive bidding put a call in () to make it opp's call
			dbl double can be described as x, dbl, db or ktr
				(rdbl) redouble as xx, rdb, rdbl, rktr or re
					p pass as p, pa, pas or pass
		PasS bid descriptions can use upper or lowercase letters
			(2♦) denomination of bids can be described using ♦/d/!d
				2!h 
					2nT notrump can be n/nt/ba
		(2c) it is OK to specify either 2 our or 2 opponent's calls in a row
			(2d) and this assumes the player in-between passes
@Lines starting with @ are notes they don't describe specific calls,
	@but can be used to convey other information
	@and can also have subnodes as well
