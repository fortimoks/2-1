&Title of the system can be optionally put in the first line of the file after & symbol
pass start each line with the description of the call and then put it's meaning
	1c then describe responses in a line starting with a single tab character
		1d then responses to that bid with double tab character at the start
			1h etc.
			1s and to describe responses for some previous bid use one more tab then the bid we're responding to, so this is a response to 1d
			1n and so is this
		1h and this is a response to 1c
			(1s) to describe competitive bidding put a call in parentheses to make it opponent's call
				dbl double can be described as x, dbl, db or ktr
					(rdbl) redouble as xx, rdb, rdbl, rktr or re
						p pass as p, pa, pas, pass
							(PasS) also all bid descriptions can use upper or lowercase letters and it's still fine
								2♦ denomination of suited bids can be described using ♦/d/!d
									2!h 
										2nT notrump can be n/nt/ba
				(2c) it is OK to specify either 2 our or 2 opponent's calls in a row and this assumes the player in-between has passed
@Lines starting with @ are notes they don't describe specific calls, but can be used to convey other information
	@And can also have subnodes as well
@For example
@Slam bidding
	4NT blackwood
		5c 1/4
		5d 0/3
		5h 2 without Q of trumps
		5s 2 with Q of trumps and no side kings
1c
	({1 level overcall}) also you can put any text describing a call in curly braces to mean ({op's call}) or {our call}
		{2 of opponent suit} GF
1d Can have for example %(Qx;JTx;Q98xx;AKx)
	@A hand can be described using this syntax, to indicade a void just leave the space between semicolons blank %(;;;AKQJTxxxxxxxx)
#Lines starting with '#' are ignored by the parser and can be used to make the file more readable for yourself
1h Also you can #put a '#' sign in the middle of the line and everything after it is a comment as well
@Non vulnerable
1nt 12-14
@Vulnerable
#Defining 1nt again would result in an error of redefining a sequence
!1nt 15-17 #you can put ! before the call to override it
	(2c) majors
		x Penalty
	#The same goes for opponent's calls, so (2c) will result in an error
	!(2c) natural #But this is fine
		x Stayman
